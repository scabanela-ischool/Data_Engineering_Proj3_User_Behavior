## BART Map

## Business Case Scenario

Assume you are a full stack data scientist at Acme Gourmet Meals (AGM).

AGM executives have heard of some new futuristic delivery and pickup options that they want to investigate at a preliminary level:
* Adding more pickup locations
* Using public transportation to transport deliveries
* Using delivery drones
* Using delivery robots
* A hybrid approach of any combination of these options

**Berkeley store, San Francisco Bay Area, BART**

For this investigation, the executives only want you to expore the Berkeley store, the San Francisco Bay Area, and BART.

**Adding more pickup locations**

Adding more pickup locations is generally considered an easy way to grow the customer base and grow the frequency that customers purchase meals.

Creating a pickup location requires renting (or purchasing) property, renovating (or building) space in a way suitable for the business.

Since the executives would be considering longer term leases (or purchases) with expensive renovation (or building), they want to see if they can future proof their location choices.

Locations at or near BART stations would be good choices because BART riders could easily pick up meals at the stations they travel through on the way to or from work.  Most would probably pick them up on the way home, but if they have refrigerators at work, some may pick them up on the way to work.

**Using public transportation to transport deliveries**

Using public transportation to transport deliveries has been used in some areas for a long time, such as the Dabbawalas in Mumbai, India, which started in the late 1800's.

In the US, informal use of public transportation has been used for messenger and delivery services in some of the larger cities.

Most large cities are starting to explore allowing organized, wide spread use of public transportation for deliveries.  Some proposals even allow for special train cars, or even special trains, strictly for delivery.

The executives want to future proof their decision on adding pickup locations to be able to take advantage of using BART to transport deliveries in the future.

**Using delivery drones**

The executives want to future proof their decision on adding pickup locations to be able to take advantage of adding delivery drones in the future.

**Using delivery robots**

The executives want to future proof their decision on adding pickup locations to be able to take advantage of adding delivery robots in the future.

**Hybrid approach**

The executives want to explore some hybrid approaches that might be possible, such as:
* Using BART to transport deliveries to various pickup locations near BART stations where customers can pickup their meals
* Using BART to transport deliveries to traditional manned delivery trucks 
* Using BART to transport deliveries to delivery drones 
* Using BART to transport deliveries to delivery robots 

**Using NoSQL databases**

So far the IT department only has SQL based traditional relational databases.  Your data science manager has discussed with the executives bringing in NoSQL databases in the cases where it makes more sense than a SQL based relational database.

The IT department has created a traditional relational data model, in Third Normal Form, 3NF, for the BART system:
* **stations** table with each station name, latitude-longitude, and average transfer time in seconds
* **lines** table with each line by color, with the sequence of stations going one way (trains move both ways, but in keeping with 3NF, they only store it one way)
* **travel_times** table with station_1, station_2, and the average travel time in seconds between then.  station_1 is alphabetically less than station_2 (trains move both ways, but in keeping with 3NF, they only store it one way).  All lines between the same two stations have the same average travel time.

The IT department has provided us with CSV files of these tables.

A NoSQL graph database such as Neo4j would be a logical choice to analyze a system such as BART.  The executives would like to hear about the differences between using a traditional SQL relational database to store graphs and using Neo4j.

The executives would also like some suggestions on how a NoSQL document store such as MongoDB and/or a NoSQL in-memory key-value store such as Redis might be used in future systems related to the hybrid deliveries.

## Coding Part

The coding part is due in week 13, on the day of your class meeting, at 11:59 pm.

The coding part will help you to develop some tools that you will find useful for your analysis for your presentation.

In part 3.1, you will create and load the stations, lines, and travel_times tables for the BART system that we received from the IT department.

In part 3.2, you will create some queries on the stations, lines, and travel_times tables for the BART system that we will use later to create the graph.

In part 3.3, you will create a graph database in Neo4j for the BART system from the queries in part 3.2.  This graph will allow you to do further analysis on the BART system, paths, centrality, etc.

In part 3.4, you will verify the graph database in Neo4j for the BART system.  You will run some shortest paths and verify that they are correct to help verify that you have created the graph correctly.

In part 3.5, you will use geodesic distances and zip code and population data to enhance our BART model.  For a station, you can find all the zip codes within X miles, the population of each zip code, and the total population.  This will allow you to analyze how much population is within a BART station area, how much population a delivery drone could service, how much population a delivery robot could service, etc.


## Presentation Part

Your group will create a presentation:
* Presented during class on week 14
* All group members need to be part of the presentation
* Target 12 minutes, plus or minus 2 minutes
* You may present as few or as many slides as you wish, whatever you think works best within time constraints
* The audience for your presentation should be executives who are familiar with basic, high level IT concepts, but not necessarily IT people

Deliveries:
* A single PDF file of your slides 
* A zip file of any additional Jupyter Notebooks that you created in addition to the coding part
* Submit by a direct message in slack
* Due at the start of your class meeting in week 14. 

Your presentation should cover the following details:
* Limit your discussion to the Berkeley store, San Francisco Bay Area, BART
* Adding more pickup locations
* Using public transportation (BART) to transport deliveries
* Using delivery drones
* Using delivery robots
* A hybrid approach of any combination of these
* NoSQL
  * Briefly compare and contrast using Neo4j versus SQL relational database tables
  * Briefly describe possible uses for MongoDB in systems involved with these processes
  * Briefly describe possible uses for Redis in systems involved with these processes

You have complete flexibility to take your presentation in any direction, as long as you cover the topics above.  

Due to time constraints, you may just want to briefly cover most topics and then focus on the most important insight for a deeper dive.

You may want to propose one or more specific solutions, or you may want to just talk in generalizations, and give specific examples to illustrate.
